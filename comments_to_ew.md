# Gemini
Regarding the fact that Gemini is less responsive than the others we will implement a last observation cried forward, or nearest neighbor approach in order to ensure the absence of missing values.

# USD or USDT
It is not sufficient that an exchange only allow for withdrawal in USDT since this would expose our issuers to market as well as operational risks.

# Regarding the fulfillment of applicable requirements
As for now, applicable should read as in "deemed to act in accordance with the law of relevant jurisdictions"

# Regarding the median of all VWAPs.
The median is chosen in order to optimize the possibility for issuers to trade on both sides of the reference price. The downside with this is that issuer risks to pay, with respect to a specific exchange, an increased liquidity premium. However, due to the construction of the reference price this liquidity premium will only reduce the possibility for arbitrage in tracking the index and never a loss with respect being forced to sell cryptocurrencies to a lower price or buy to a higher price than the reference price, which is the price that the investor pays.
An average could be considered a more true price and in the long run could offer better arbitrage opportunities. However, reducing the operational risk off not being able to access necessary exchanges has made us choose the median approach.
